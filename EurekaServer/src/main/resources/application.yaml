 # Eureka server should run on 172.17.0.1 ip address inside the container always, so that the 
 # this ip address can be given to Eureka clients to register .
 # If we do not set this ip address, then docker container will create some dynamic port and eureka clients will not be able to find that port and resgister.
 #To run in local, change to - localhost
